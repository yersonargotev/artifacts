## Claude Code execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.claude/skills`; personal skills under `~/.claude/skills`.

Delegate through the Agent tool with an available agent type, such as general-purpose; use only parameters exposed by this session. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/claude-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

Claude manual-only dependencies must be read as files; do not invoke them through the Skill tool or preload them as model-invoked skills.

Restate in your own words what you think the user's goals are and what problem they're trying to solve.
