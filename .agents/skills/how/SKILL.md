## Codex execution

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read sibling pstack skills from this installation, not from another host's roots. Project skills belong under `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.agents/skills`.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

# How

Explore the codebase to answer "how does X work?" questions. Produce architectural explanations at the level of a senior engineer onboarding onto a subsystem, enough to build a working mental model, not so much that it reads like annotated source code.

Each spawn below names a role line in the `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` file and a default. Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If a configured model is unavailable, inherit the host model and disclose the fallback.

## Step 1. Assess Complexity

If the scope is ambiguous, state your interpretation and explore. The user can redirect.

- **Simple** (a single module, a small utility, a narrow question such as "how does function X work"): no explorers. One explainer explores and explains in a single pass. Go to Step 2b.
- **Complex** (a subsystem spanning multiple files or services, a cross-cutting feature, a full architectural overview): spawn parallel explorers first, then hand off to the explainer. Go to Step 2a.

When in doubt, take the simple path.

## Step 2a. Explore (complex questions only)

Decompose the question into 2 to 4 exploration angles, each a distinct slice of the subsystem. Spawn all explorers in a single message:

- agent type: a general-purpose type exposed by this host
- `model`: the `how explorer` line, default `inherit-parent`
- Permissions: read-only intent; inspect the actual authorized delegated tools, including any needed connectors.

Each explorer gets the prompt in `references/explorer-prompt.md` with its angle filled in. Then go to Step 3.

## Step 2b. Direct Explain (simple questions)

Spawn one host subagent that explores and explains in one pass:

- agent type: a general-purpose type exposed by this host
- `model`: the `how explainer` line, default `inherit-parent`
- Permissions: read-only intent; inspect the actual authorized delegated tools, including any needed connectors.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` without the explorer-findings section. Go to Step 4.

## Step 3. Synthesize (complex questions only)

Once all explorers have returned, spawn one host subagent to synthesize their findings into one explanation:

- agent type: a general-purpose type exposed by this host
- `model`: the `how explainer` line, default `inherit-parent`
- Permissions: read-only intent; inspect the actual authorized delegated tools, including any needed connectors.

Build its prompt from `references/explainer-prompt.md` with every explorer's findings filled in.

## Step 4. Present

Present the explainer's output to the user. Light edits for clarity or context from the conversation are fine. Do not substantially rewrite it.

## Output Format

The explanation uses the sections defined in `references/explainer-prompt.md`, dropping any that do not apply: Overview, Key Concepts, How It Works, Where Things Live, Gotchas.
