## Codex execution

This is a Codex-specific workflow carried by the Agents convention. A shared Agents binding does not provide Codex tools, model choice, or delegation; use only capabilities authorized and available in the actual client.

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

Before starting, ask how a top expert would approach this task (their raw sources, their real methods, an outside check that the result is right), what the user is really after, and whether the task is over- or underspecified. Loosen constraints that don't serve the goal as readily as you add ones that do, and leave choices that are the user's to make open instead of deciding them. Fold in only what makes the work better, not bigger, but always keep one outside check that the result is right, without narrating the framing, then do the work.
